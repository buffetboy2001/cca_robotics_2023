## Introduction

introduce the mindstorms terminal
- imports
- comments
- where to type code
- white space
- show errors and how to read them
show help module
show how to control the:
- beep
- status light
- speaker

**Challenge**: use the help documentation to control the light matrix, showing the image of a butterfly

> switch team mate who is typing

## Conditionals

Introduce `if` concept
- single boolean
- whitespace!!!
- multiple boolean
- `else`
- `elif`

Introduce `motion_sensor`:
    **Logic Challenge**: only show it if the hub was `tapped` (requires use of `if`)

variables like algrebra
show the print function for variables
mathmatical operations

**Challenge**: solve a 3-4-5 triangle for the hypotenuse and display solution on the hub: `math.sqrt(b)`

## Motion

Build the robot on pg 144
Basic motion
Challenge: Turn code on pg 144 into python

## Flow Control

loops
- while
- for `range`
Then code on pg 145 into python
